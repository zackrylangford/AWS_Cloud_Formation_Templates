### Additions and Changes to Make

### These are edits to my "finalized" templates that I need/want to make

1. Add multiple subnet options as a drop down menu in the Launch VPC templates (192.168.0.0/16, etc.) 
so that I have more options available for creating the private network

2. Add mappings so that the templates can be launched out of any region. 
Need mappings for Regions, availability zones?, etc. 

3. Need to finish going through and commenting on all of the templates
in order to help make it clear how to use the templates in the future. 

4. Create diagrams and save them alongside the templates for a visual 
representation of each template
